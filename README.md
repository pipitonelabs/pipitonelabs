## Welcome 👋

My name is Joe, and I am a Cloud Engineer working on AWS, Azure, Infrastructure & Automation, and GitOps / Kubernetes.

- 🔭 Kubernetes inspires me.

- 🌱 I plan on learning n8n next.

- 💾 I like to continuously expand my knowledge using my homelab environment to deploy and experiment with open source technologies.

- 🤔 I’m actively searching for a new full time Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Systems Engineer role.
